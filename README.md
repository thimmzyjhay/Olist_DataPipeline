# Olist Ecommerce DataPipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements the design and deployment of an end‑to‑end data engineering pipeline using **the Olist OLTP dataset**.  
Raw transactional data is ingested from **AWS S3** into a **Snowflake warehouse**, then transformed with **dbt** into analytics ready tables for reporting and advanced analytics.
The objective is to convert raw operational data into a scalable analytical warehouse that supports business intelligence and data science use cases.

## Problem Statement
Brazil's e-commerce sector has grown rapidly, but companies face challenges in understanding customer behavior, logistics performance, and satisfaction drivers. The Olist dataset captures the full order lifecycle from purchase to delivery and review across thousands of sellers and customers nationwide.

Without proper data integration and transformation, businesses cannot:
- Identify bottlenecks in delivery times and freight costs.
- Understand payment patterns and customer preferences.
- Track customer satisfaction through reviews and ratings.
- Evaluate seller and product performance across regions.

## Project Architecture
The pipeline demonstrates the architecture of a modern cloud native data stack, including:
```
AWS S3 (Raw Files)
      │
      ▼
Snowflake – BRONZE Schema  (Raw ingestion layer)
      │
      ▼
Snowflake – SILVER Schema  (Staging: cleaned & standardized via dbt)
      │
      ▼
Snowflake – GOLD Schema    (Marts: dimensional models for analytics)
```
### Architecture Components
| Component | Tool |
|---|---|
| Cloud Storage | AWS S3 |
| Cloud Data Warehouse | Snowflake |
| Transformation Framework | dbt (ELT) |
| Data Modelling | Star Schema / Dimensional Modelling |
| Orchestration | dbt CLI |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |


### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- OLTP → OLAP transformation
- Dimensional modelling and star schema design
- Modern ELT architecture with dbt
- Medallion Architecture (Bronze / Silver / Gold)
- Cloud-native ingestion and transformation pipeline
- Custom dbt macros for schema management

## Dataset
The Olist dataset consists of 8 interrelated tables representing the full e-commerce order lifecycle:
| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `orders` | Customer orders and their status/timestamps |
| `order_items` | Line items within each order including price and freight |
| `customers` | Customer details and geolocation |
| `products` | Product catalog with category and dimensions |
| `sellers` | Seller information and location |
| `order_reviews` | Customer review scores and comments |
| `order_payments` | Payment transactions and methods |
| `product_category_translation` | Portuguese to English category name mapping |

### Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Cloud Storage | AWS S3 |
| Data Warehouse | Snowflake |
| Transformation | dbt Core |
| Language | SQL |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |
| Orchestration | dbt CLI (local) |
| Documentation | dbt docs + GitHub |

## ELT Process

- **Extract**: Raw e‑commerce data is ingested from **AWS S3** into the data pipeline.  
- **Load**: The extracted data is loaded into the **Snowflake warehouse** under the `E_COMMERCE.BRONZE` schema.  
- **Transform**: Using **dbt**, transformations are executed directly inside Snowflake:  
   - **Staging models (SILVER)** standardize formats, clean data, and apply business rules.  
   - **Mart models (GOLD)** aggregate data into dimensional structures for analytics and reporting.  

**Flow:** **AWS S3 → Snowflake (Bronze) → dbt (Silver) → dbt (Gold)**

| `stg_order_reviews` | Cleaned review scores and comments |
| `stg_products` | Standardized product catalog |
| `stg_sellers` | Cleaned seller records |
| `stg_product_category_translation` | Mapped category translations |

**Marts (Gold)**
*Dimensions:*
| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `dim_customers` | Customer dimension |
| `dim_products` | Product dimension |
| `dim_sellers` | Seller dimension |
| `dim_orders` | Order dimension |

*Facts:*
| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `fct_order_items` | Order items fact table |
